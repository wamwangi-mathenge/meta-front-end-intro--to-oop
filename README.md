# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

OOP revolves around the idea of organizing our programs using objects to group related data and functionality.

In functional programming, the data used in the app needs to be kept separate from functions that operate on the data.

An advantage of using the OOP approach is that you can build as many objects as you need.

This repository aims to highlight the differences between the Functional Programming Paradigm and the Object-Oriented Programming paradigm using a simple program that calculates the cost of a pir of shoes given its parameters.

This repository also demonstrates how to use the "this" keyword to avoid code wastage while referencing objects in OOP.
